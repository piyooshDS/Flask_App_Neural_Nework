# Flask_App_Neural_Nework

In this web application, we create a SPA (single-page app) with a form where bank agents can fill in the details,  and based on those details, a  machine learning model will decide whether a loan should be given to the customer or not.

In this project, I learned:
- performed data analysis on the dataset in order to learn about it.
- carried out EDA (handling null and missing values, data normalization, and so on).
- developed the neural network (a classification model based on deep learning).
- improved model performance by tuning model parameters.
- Create a template and use Flask to pass the data into the saved model.
- predicted the model decision and communicated it to the user
